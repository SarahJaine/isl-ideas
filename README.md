## Developing

### Requirements

* Python 3
* [foreman](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/)

### Python and Django

First you need to configure your environment:

```
cp env.example .env
```

Edit *.env* and set the values you need to run the project locally. 

Next, create a Python 3 virtual environment and install the requirements:

```
mkvirtualenv --python=$(which python3) isl-ideas
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create the database specified in *.env*, run the initial model migration,
and create a super user:

```
createdb islideas
foreman run python manage.py migrate
foreman run python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Front End Tools

Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install the correct version
of Node.js and install the front-end dependencies:

```
nvm install
npm install
```

Do an initial build of assets:

```
gulp build
```

## Running the Project

First load the virtualenv:

```
workon isl-ideas
```

Then use [foreman](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/) (or [forego](https://github.com/ddollar/forego)) to run the development processes:

```
foreman start -f Procfile.dev
```

*Procfile.dev* defines the following processes:

* web: the Django development server
* static: the gulp watch process


`foreman start -f Procfile.dev` will start all of the processes at once. If you
want to run a specific process, you can specify it directly:

```
foreman start -f Procfile.dev web
```

### Procfile

When deployed to production or staging, the application and any other processes will be run as defined in the Procfile. You can run this file locally using [foreman](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/) to launch the application the same way it will be run in production:

```
foreman start
```

You are **highly encouraged** to do this before finishing features to make sure the app runs as expected before it is deployed.

##Deployment

pushing to master autodeploys to staging application
